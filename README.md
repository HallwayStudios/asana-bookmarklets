# Asana Bookmarklets

Asana is great. But sometimes, little shortcuts or functionality you want doesn't exist.
This is a collection of JavaScript that runs in your web browser, as Bookmarklets.

## Usage
Browse the code of this repo to find JavaScript files which you can add as bookmarklets to your browser bookmarks toolbar / folder.

You'll need to paste the code from this repo into a Bookmarklet generator, such as the excellent [Bookmarkleter by Chris Zarate](https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/).
